# TCP-IP-Centralized-Server
Author: George Freedland

Description: A functional Client-Server Centralized Network that provides messaging/chat services to multiple clients. Python version: 3.8.4 (64-bit version) Challenges: The main challenges were to develop a protocol and proper testing so the correct flow of information would occur. If I had more time and possibly in the future I would have developed a broadcast method for the server to broadcast a message to all the clients at the same time.
